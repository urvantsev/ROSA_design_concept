Documentation of ROSA's design concept.

## How to make ROSA_design_concept.pdf from .tex file

Install "texlive-base" package and "texlive-pictures".

On debian-based systems:

```
$sudo apt-get install texlive-base texlive-pictures
```

Then run "make" from the .../ROSA_design_concept directory to build .pdf
file from .tex file:

```
$make
```

You can also run "make clean" to deal with .log and other unnecessary
files:

```
$make clean
```
