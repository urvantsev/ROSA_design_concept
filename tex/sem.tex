\section{Semaphores}
Semaphores are stored as follows in the system.

Semaphores can't be deleted if locked. 
    
Due to the way the IPCP works, it is not necessary to store blocked
tasks in a data structure separate from the structure for ready tasks.
Since a blocked task can only be blocked by a task of equal (aka
maximum) priority, running through the entire list in a FIFO way will
make sure the semaphore is unlocked, allowing the task to execute
normally. If the system is changed such that tasks of equal priority are
ran in a Round Robin style, this will pose the problem again, requiring
a change in the way blocked tasks are handled. In order to keep track of
the maximum ceiling for the IPCP, all locked semaphores are stored in an
unsorted list.
