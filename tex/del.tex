\section{Delays}
For the implementation of delays, the system needs to
keep track of tasks that are currently waiting to resume execution. In
this system this will be done by a queue which is sorted by the wake up
time of each task it contains, with the earliest deadline first. The
next design choice is between a hardware timer and polling in the ISR
which drives the system clock. With the first one we can simply set the
timer to expire when the task with the earliest deadline needs to wake
up, and handling the resulting interrupt by waking the task. However,
this takes a valuable timer, of which there are only three. Therefore
this approach will not be taken, and instead the ISR of the timer
already in use will poll the first task in the queue every system tick
(1ms) to see if the task needs to wake up yet.
